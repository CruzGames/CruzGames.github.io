However, they soon fell in love with their tempestuous wards and many of them broke with their vows of guardianship and entered into a more forbidden relationship.  The result of these indelicate unions was a new race of beings: The Nephilim.",

The Grigori were banished from heaven and cast into the cavernous prison of Tartarus to pay for their sins while a great flood was sent to wash the earth of Nephilim.",

During this time in hiding, they evolved, bred and divided by factions.  They are known today as Vampires, Werewolves, and Zombies.  To save Man, the Grigori have now been released from their prison to finally destroy the children of their children.",
