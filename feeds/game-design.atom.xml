&lt;p&gt;It's been a couple weeks now since we launched and I have definitely heard the in-app purchasing (IAP) we have is confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our next release, I will certainly be changing the wording on it to help clarify how it works.  It appears that potential players think that you have to spend $40 just to unlock the campaign and get some tiles.  That's just not the case.  We've got several hours of free campaign gameplay in there plus as much pass-and-play multiplayer as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an F2P designer, I can honestly say I HATE when games are free, but they make it so hard or impossible to play that you have to buy in-game currency.  That is an awful bait-and-switch and I won't have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three cardinal rules (in my opinion) on free-to-play game design that must be followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must not enable "Pay for Power" in multiplayer games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must not sell an unfinishable, crippled game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any IAP should either enhance the player's experience or save the player time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I think the word "Shortcut" instead of "Unlock" might be the key there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="title-divider"&gt;How the IAP Actually &lt;strong&gt;Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IAP basically comes in two flavors: &lt;strong&gt;random tile packs&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;campaign shortcuts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;random tile packs&lt;/strong&gt; operate like standard CCG card packs, but with tiles.  In the most basic pack, you'll get three commons and one uncommon.  The uncommon having a 25% chance of being a rare.  From there, they differ in price-per-tile, commonality, and faction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;campaign shortcuts&lt;/strong&gt; (previously called unlocks!) are really just ways to skip all the randomness, while skipping ahead in the campaign story to the harder stages.  With these unlocks, you get all the tiles earned normally during that campaign chapter, plus, you'll skip to the next campaign chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as I stated in my 3 cardinal rules, you don't need to buy anything to play through the entire campaign while earning enough tiles to make full, playable tilesets.  In fact, you earn all the tiles (I've created so far) in the game by playing through the first 3 of the 6 available chapters in the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="title-divider"&gt;What Tiles Do You &lt;strong&gt;Earn?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to what tiles you actually earn while playing through the campaign (or buying a shortcut), I realized I don't actually list them anywhere.  We're going to remedy that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 class="title-divider"&gt;Chapter One: &lt;strong&gt;Betrayal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, hopefully this clears up any questions remaining about our IAP and helps everyone to see that, yes, there really are free games out there that are honestly free.  If, alone the way, you'd like to enhance your Grigori Stones experience (you'd just like to help an indie dev out) we're enabling you to spend a bit of money to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why don't you give it a try?  Play through The Grigori Stones campaign and tell me what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

You know, the basic parts, at least.  If you're feeling lacking in those areas, I can point you to some pretty great resources to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 class="title-divider"&gt;Amazing &lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt; on Freemiums and Fans&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gamesbrief.com/rules/"&gt;What are the rules?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://pages.gameacademy.com/gameacademy-gamekit/"&gt;What are some best practices?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.swrve.com/resources"&gt;What does the industry look like?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Curve-Companies-High-Value-Customers/dp/1591846633/"&gt;But only 1.5% of my players actually pay!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Long-Tail-Endless-Creating-Unlimited-ebook/dp/B000JMKSE2/"&gt;How do I compete with the big names?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/1000-true-fans/"&gt;What is the minimum I need to survive?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There now, we're all experts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, how do you apply all of this newly-found knowledge you've acquired?  That's where I can come in and help by giving you and example of how I've assembled all of this into what you see in The Grigori Stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 class="title-divider"&gt;Finding a &lt;strong&gt; Theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I made the &lt;em&gt;decision&lt;/em&gt; to finally design something &lt;span class="hue"&gt;for the market&lt;/span&gt; instead of something I felt like was &lt;span class="hue"&gt;for me&lt;/span&gt;.  This was a hard decision to make, but I was tired of making games (the few that I actually finished) that went nowhere because they couldn't find an audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I originally thought about The Grigori Stones as a fantasy RPG-style game.  Instead, I changed it to be more about Supernatural creatures as that seems to be the 800-pound gorilla in the mass-market trend battle arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Supernatural critters like Zombies, Vampires, and Werewolves are popular with most segments of the entertainment-consuming populace, unlike my personal favorite, High Fantasy.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Theme?  Check!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class="title-divider"&gt;Choosing the &lt;strong&gt;Genre&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the popular genres and platform strengths (I knew I was making a mobile game), I decided to go with Multiplayer, Turn-based, and Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the first two, Multiplayer and Turn-based, are all about getting the maximum number of people together to play my game.  Multiplayer is obvious, but Turn-based?  It enables more people to play together as they don't have to be online at the exact same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has two effects, really.  One is that more people can play, thus, more people will share my game out.  Two is I can now capture the player time in between turns with activities like managing their tileset and (most important!) purchasing and unwrapping new tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i class="icon icon-ok"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span&gt;Multiplayer&lt;/span&gt; because that unlocks virality and all of the "User Acquisition" pieces that go along with it.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i class="icon icon-ok"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span&gt;Turn-Based&lt;/span&gt; because the asynchronous style (rather than synchronous multiplayer) allows more people to play together.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i class="icon icon-ok"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span&gt;Strategy&lt;/span&gt; because it fits well with the first two items and it's one of the top genres on the Apple App Store.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Game genre?  Check!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class="title-divider"&gt;Finding the right &lt;strong&gt;Mechanics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided I was going to make a game with strong replayability and build-once-use-over-and-over content.  &lt;span&gt;The natural fit here was a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_card_game"&gt;TCG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; because of those reasons, but also because of the tight monetization model behind it.  Unfortunately this had its own set of various problems as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a substantial glut in the market of trading card games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the trading card games typically play exactly alike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They're complex to learn and have a heavy random element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the neat genre-derivatives, from Rage of Bahamut to Hearthstone to Hero Academy, felt either too derivative or not strategic enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The environment of the game board should be more important!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind first went to TCG + &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego"&gt;Stratego&lt;/a&gt;, but that would make local pass-and-play multiplayer awkward as you needed to hide your tile placement from the other player.  That's when I started to explore concepts like Dominoes and Scrabble for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I settled on Multiplayer TCG + Stratego + &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong"&gt;Mahjong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i class="icon icon-ok"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Collectible game assets? Yes!
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i class="icon icon-ok"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Affecting the environment? Yes!
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i class="icon icon-ok"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Simple rules?  Yes!
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i class="icon icon-ok"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Deep strategy?  Yes!
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Core mechanics?  Check!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 class="title-divider"&gt;Exploring the &lt;strong&gt;Core Loop Skeleton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, it was really about prototyping it to find the possibility of fun.  &lt;span&gt;The best way to do this was really with the two sets of dominoes&lt;/span&gt; I, of course, had laying around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Every game designer should always have piles of playing cards, dominoes, scrabble tiles, dice, beads, counters, colored paper just laying around.  This makes quick and dirty prototyping really easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some experimentation with friends and family, I hit upon what I felt was the right level of interaction between the moves, the board position, your options, and the concept of a "hand".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, these were the basic rules coming out of the play prototyping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On your turn, you can -&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i class="icon-ok darkgrey"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span&gt;Move a free tile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i class="icon-ok darkgrey"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span&gt;Attack a free tile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i class="icon-ok darkgrey"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span&gt;Use a free tile's ability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i class="icon-ok darkgrey"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span&gt;Place a tile from your hand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, the next turn goes over to your opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 class="title-divider"&gt;Where to from here?&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I've got the core pieces in place, it's really all about designing the experience around them.  Figuring out the three primary pillars of &lt;span class="hue"&gt;User Acquisition, Retention, and Monetization&lt;/span&gt; using all the tools in my arsenal.  Things like &lt;span&gt;Goal Progression, Re-engagement, Consumables, Anchoring, Feedback, Affordance, and Rewards&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this sheds a bit of light on how I build games from their core pieces, but leave room for wiggling as I tackle those big three success pillars.  I'll cover each of the pillars in depth as I continue this series, but most importantly, I want to point out how game designers build their games from the ground up with specific targets in mind.  There is never a moment where you should be making decisions without an objective, rational reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I suggest you study up and be ready!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="howto"></category><category term="design"></category><category term="f2p"></category><category term="f2pDesignSeries"></category></entry><entry><title>The One About Tutorials</title><link href="http://blog.grigoristones.com/the-one-about-tutorials.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-08-01T08:07:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Luis Cruz</name></author><id>tag:blog.grigoristones.com,2014-08-01:the-one-about-tutorials.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;First of all, I would like to apologize for starting this Dev Blog so late.  I suppose I should have been writing it up all the while, but I hadn't really thought about it much until a friend of mine mentioned it to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this first entry, I would really like to talk about how I did the tutorial.  I feel like it's fairly innovative.  Or, at the very least, I think it's not a technique that's used very often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always felt like standard tutorial levels in games were actually pretty terrible.  They tend to be a series of little, highlighted steps where you can't click anything except the one button they make you click.  I don't know about you, but I tend to just get into the "Click, click, click. Next, next, next, just get me finished with this so I can get to the game." mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's either that, or what they've recently come to start calling "Coach Marks" which is even worse.  That's where they overlay your interface with what looks like chalk boxes and arrows describing all the parts of the UI.  In that case, it implication is their interface is so complicated at the beginning that it needs descriptions of all the parts.  Which means they're so complicated you'll immediately forget them once you hit "Okay!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the best way?  Glad you asked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, there are a couple of things that make, in my opinion, the best onboarding to a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 1) Hide unnecessary interface elements early on. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't really need to see a bunch of HUD elements meant to give you feedback for later parts in your game on level one.  Once your player is acclimated, then you can bring in the "Oh, it keeps track of something called Sheckles!  I wonder how I earn them..." UI elements.  Until then, they just serve as distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, you can passively guide your player into what needs to be interacted with without dropping them on a screen with a billion things that might need clicking for level 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/static/blogimages/blog_guided_ui_snap.png" data-rel="prettyPhoto"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/static/blogimages/blog_guided_ui_snap.png" alt="" width="50%" class="pull-right"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the player has discovered your core loop (because that's all you're showing them), then you can start adding complexity to that loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example in this case is when I am stripping out the ability to swivel the board, move tiles, place tiles, interact with your hand, etc. on the first level in The Grigori Stones.  This removes any ambiguity on what the players are supposed to be learning on this first level -- attacking and the concept of "free tiles".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this screenshot, the player is supposed to take their second action of the tutorial level by attacking a Zombie Rookie on the board.  This screen pops up if they try to place a tile from their hand instead of attacking with one on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 2) Give just-in-time guidance according to the action they just took &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is about confirming their discoveries.  Once you've stripped away all of the UI except the very parts you will need to interact with "right now", you'll want to give them guidance once they've interacted with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can get a bit tricky if not done well.  You may leave your player with the feeling of helplessness and "I don't know what to do!"  You can combat this by having a timed window pop up if they sit there too long in fearful indecision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/static/blogimages/blog_tutorial_snap.png" data-rel="prettyPhoto"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/static/blogimages/blog_tutorial_snap.png" alt="" width="50%" class="pull-left"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it will be very important for these first early steps that the player doesn't fail.  The tutorial area is a safe zone and the player cannot fail.  It's simply to expose the core loop.  Once they've got that, then, you can add in and explicitly call out features that introduce your player to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, in this screenshot, the player has successfully tapped their own Freemason Rookie tile and I'm telling the player what to do now that they've selected it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I'm reminding the player about what constitutes a "Free Tile" at the same time.  A good rule of thumb is reminding them three times because, as we all know, players don't actually read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I think that's about it for today.  Again, sorry I haven't written anything up to this point and all of the development for the MVP is basically done.  I have many, many ideas for new tiles and features though, so I'm sure we'll chat again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best,&lt;br/&gt;
